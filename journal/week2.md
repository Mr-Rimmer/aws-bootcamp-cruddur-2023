# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## **Dropping out of participation after week 4** 

###**Reason**
It's extremely difficult to complete tasks on time in an individual bases without access to discord  ( as this is where you solve most of the issues I'm encountering). 

So far am working at week 4,  However it's just too time consuming fault finding all these little issues without access to support. **_Example I have a CORS issue I've been working on for some hours now, this is a blocker to moveing to the next topic..    


**Therefore**  - The best value now is to continue working along with your content - but no longer take active part. ( I do record my activity on onenote and will add to the journal ad-hoc)  

###Cheers and thanks for all the efforts Andrew and team.
