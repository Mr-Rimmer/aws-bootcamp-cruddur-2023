# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## **Saddly I shall Dropping out of active participation after week 4** 

### **Reason**
It's extremely difficult to complete tasks on time in an individual bases without access to discord  ( as this is where you solve most of the issues I'm encountering). 

So far am working at week 4,  However it's just too time consuming fault finding all these little issues without access to support. 
**Example:** _I have a CORS issue I've been working on for some hours now, this is a blocker to moveing to the next topic..    

**Therefore**  - The best value now is to continue working along with your content each week - But no longer take active part. ( I will be adding to the my journal ad-hoc )  

### I have greatly enjoyed your Bootcamp and will Continue to do so, albeit from the sidelines
### Cheers and thanks for all the efforts Andrew and team.
